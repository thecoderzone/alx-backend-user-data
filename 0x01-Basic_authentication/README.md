Simple API
Simple HTTP API for playing with User model.

Files
models/
base.py: base of all models of the API - handle serialization to file
user.py: user model
api/v1
app.py: entry point of the API
views/index.py: basic endpoints of the API: /status and /stats
views/users.py: all users endpoints
Setup
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Run
$ API_HOST=0.0.0.0 API_PORT=5000 python3 -m api.v1.app
Routes
GET /api/v1/status: returns the status of the API
GET /api/v1/stats: returns some stats of the API
GET /api/v1/users: returns the list of users
GET /api/v1/users/:id: returns an user based on the ID
DELETE /api/v1/users/:id: deletes an user based on the ID
POST /api/v1/users: creates a new user (JSON parameters: email, password, last_name (optional) and first_name (optional))
PUT /api/v1/users/:id: updates an user based on the ID (JSON parameters: last_name and first_name)

General
What authentication means
What Base64 is
How to encode a string in Base64
What Basic authentication means
How to send the Authorization header
Requirements
A README.md file.
